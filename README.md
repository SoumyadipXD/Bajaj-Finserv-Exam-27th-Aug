# Bajaj-Finserv-Exam-27th-Aug

I’m Soumyadip Chowdhury. I’m submitting my Bajaj Finserv HealthRx Assignment. I’ve used Mapbox instead of Google map because I don’t have the google map api. All the requirements have been fulfilled using.

For the brownie points:

1. Users will get a new color every time when he/she load a new window.

2. User can launch max 5 Rafel, after that he will receive a message that “Rafale successfully delivered to India”.

3. After 5 successful delivery the window appears that “Rafale successfully delivered to India”.
