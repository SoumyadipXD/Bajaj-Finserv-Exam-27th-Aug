’m Soumyadip Chowdhury. I’m submitting my Bajaj Finserv HealthRx Assignment. I’ve used Mapbox instead of Google map because I don’t have the google map api. All the requirements have been fulfilled using.  For the brownie points:  1. Users will get a new color every time when he/she load a new window.  2. User can launch max 5 Rafel, after that he will receive a message that “Rafale successfully delivered to India”.  3. After 5 successful delivery the window appears that “Rafale successfully delivered to India”.
